<h1> Music Genre Classification </h1>
<h3> By Andrew Wray </h3>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 900px">
    This small web app uses a neural network to predict the genre of a song you upload.
    The network can predict one of ten genres:
    pop, metal, disco, blues, reggae, classical, rock, hip-hop, country, and jazz. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    To use it, select a music file from your computer to be 
    fed into the genre classifier, and then click the Predict button below. 
    This app currently supports .wav (recommended), .ogg, and .flac file types, though 
    larger files (such as 24-bit high quality flac) are not recommended and may
    break the program. Mp3 files are not currently supported.
